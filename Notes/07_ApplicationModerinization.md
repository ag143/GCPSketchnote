[<img src="./../images/Intro_App_Dev_and_Modernization.png" width=1100>](https://thecloudgirl.dev/NEXT2020.html) | [<sup>:link:</sup>](https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/google-cloud-next/complete-list-of-announcements-from-google-cloud-next20-onair)

So you've decided to leverage the cloud for your next application – a smart move! But before diving in, there are a few key questions to consider, as they'll shape your entire development process and the tools you'll need:

- Modernization or Greenfield?  Are you revamping an existing on-premise application for the cloud, or building a brand new cloud-native application from scratch?

- Cloud or Hybrid?  Will your application reside solely in the cloud (public cloud), or will it integrate with on-premise systems in a hybrid environment, or even span multiple cloud providers (multicloud)?

These initial choices will determine the most suitable cloud deployment strategy for your project. Let's explore each option in more detail to help you pick the right fit!

# Migration Journey
[<img src="./../images/MigrationJourney.jpg" width=1100>](https://thecloudgirl.dev/NEXT2020.html) | [<sup>:link:</sup>](https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/google-cloud-next/complete-list-of-announcements-from-google-cloud-next20-onair)

A successful application migration to the cloud starts with understanding where you are. Here's how to plan a winning strategy:

- Take a Holistic View:  Don't just focus on technical aspects. Consider your business goals (present and future), critical deadlines, and your team's capabilities.

- Identify Your Time-to-Value:  Different migration approaches offer varying speeds to value realization. There's no one-size-fits-all solution, but the key is knowing you can always build on your progress and unlock more cloud benefits incrementally.

Streamline Development with CI/CD

Imagine a world where catching bugs is a breeze and deployments are smooth sailing. That's the power of CI/CD.

- Continuous Integration (CI):
 Identify and fix issues early! With CI, you integrate code changes frequently, not all at once. Each integration triggers an automated build, allowing you to detect problems quickly and prevent them from snowballing.

- Continuous Delivery (CD):
 CD takes CI a step further. It automates packaging and preparing your software for delivery, enabling frequent releases of incremental changes to users. Deployment strategies like red/black or canary deployments minimize risk by introducing changes to a limited audience first.

Benefits of CI/CD:

- Reduced Risk: Catch problems early and release with confidence.

- Faster Releases: Deploy changes quickly and iterate on features more frequently.

- Simplified Process: Automated builds and deployments free developers to focus on what they do best – writing great code.


# Microservice Architecture
[<img src="./../images/MicroservicesArchitecture.jpg" width=1100>](https://thecloudgirl.dev/NEXT2020.html) | [<sup>:link:</sup>](https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/google-cloud-next/complete-list-of-announcements-from-google-cloud-next20-onair)

The tech landscape has evolved rapidly, introducing game-changers like containerization, container orchestration, and serverless services.  These advancements empower you to develop distributed applications based on microservices architectures, offering:

- Enhanced Scalability: Easily scale individual services to meet growing demands.

- Improved Reliability: Isolate failures to prevent cascading disruptions.

What are Microservices?

Microservices architecture breaks down large applications into smaller, independent services. Each service owns a specific function, and microservices applications combine these services to deliver complete user experiences.

Containers: Perfect Partners for Microservices

Containers provide a lightweight and isolated environment for each microservice, allowing developers to focus on service logic without worrying about dependency conflicts. Modern cloud-native applications often leverage containers and microservices together.

Deploying Microservices on Google Cloud

Google Cloud offers seamless deployment options for your microservices:

- Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE): A managed container orchestration service for deploying and managing containerized applications.

- Cloud Run: A fully managed serverless platform that removes server management complexities.

Beyond Deployment: A Rich Ecosystem

Google Cloud offers a comprehensive suite of services that integrate with your microservices architecture, including Cloud SQL and various other tools to support your specific needs.

# Service Orchestration
[<img src="./../images/serviceorchestration.jpg" width=1100>](https://thecloudgirl.dev/NEXT2020.html) | [<sup>:link:</sup>](https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/google-cloud-next/complete-list-of-announcements-from-google-cloud-next20-onair)

Microservices: Power and Coordination

Moving from monolithic applications to microservices brings significant advantages like reusability, scalability, and simpler modifications.  However, these independent services need to communicate to solve complex business problems. This is where event-driven architectures come in.

Event-Driven Communication: Two Key Approaches

Event-driven architectures enable microservices to communicate by exchanging messages about events that occur within each service. There are two main ways to implement this:

- Choreography: Microservices publish events and listen for relevant events from other services, reacting independently. They are responsible for their own logic and interactions.

- Orchestration: A central service, often an orchestrator, dictates the sequence of events and manages communication between microservices. This approach offers more control but can become a bottleneck.

Choosing the right approach depends on your specific needs and the complexity of your microservices interactions.

# API Management

[<img src="./../images/APIManagement.jpg" width=1100>](https://thecloudgirl.dev/NEXT2020.html) | [<sup>:link:</sup>](https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/google-cloud-next/complete-list-of-announcements-from-google-cloud-next20-onair)

APIs are the building blocks of today's modern applications, fueling innovation and collaboration across businesses. They empower companies to:

- Move Faster: Streamline development and delivery of applications.

- Boost Innovation: Foster a culture of open ecosystems for richer functionalities.

- Stay Competitive: Unlock new opportunities and partnerships.

However, managing APIs securely and efficiently across complex environments – on-premise, private/public cloud, SaaS, and more – can be a challenge. This is where API management comes in.

Introducing API Management: Simplifying the API Landscape

Imagine you have a complex backend with various services – REST/SOAP, microservices, and third-party integrations. You also have diverse consumers – partners, employees, and customers – all relying on APIs to access or manipulate data.

API management helps bridge this gap by:

- Centralized Control: Securely deliver, manage, and analyze APIs, data, and services.

- Developer Portal: Provide a user-friendly platform for developers to discover, explore, and utilize your APIs.

- Streamlined Consumption: Make it easy for various applications to interact with your backend services.

Unlocking the Value of APIs

Developers can leverage API management to:

- Compose Innovative Applications: Build powerful applications by easily integrating with your APIs.

- Thriving Ecosystems: Contribute to a flourishing digital ecosystem where businesses collaborate and co-create value.

# Cloud Operations

Breaking Down a Web App: Essential Components

Every web application relies on a foundation of key building blocks:

- Web Server: Handles incoming user requests and delivers web content.

- Application Server: Executes the application's business logic.

- Database: Stores and manages the application's data.

- Load Balancer: Distributes incoming traffic across multiple servers for optimal performance.

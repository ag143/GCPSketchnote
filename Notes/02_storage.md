[<img src="./../images/Storage_type.png" width=1100>](https://thecloudgirl.dev/NEXT2020.html) | [<sup>:link:</sup>](https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/google-cloud-next/complete-list-of-announcements-from-google-cloud-next20-onair)


Choosing the Right Storage for Your Applications. There are three main categories of data storage applications use: object storage, block storage, and file storage. Each offers unique advantages depending on your needs.

- Object Storage: Ideal for large, unstructured data like media files, backups, and logs. Objects are self-contained units with unique IDs and metadata for easy access. Think of it like a giant warehouse with labeled boxes – you can quickly find what you need without worrying about folders or directories. Cloud Storage is a good example of object storage.

- Block Storage:  Perfect for high-performance applications like databases and virtual machines. Data is divided into fixed-size blocks, offering fast access and flexibility. Imagine a set of building blocks – you can arrange them in any order to create what you need. Block storage like Persistent Disk and Local SSD is a good choice for demanding workloads.

- File Storage:  Think of your computer's folders and files – that's file storage. Data is organized in a hierarchical structure for easy browsing and access. Network Attached Storage (NAS) is a common type, allowing multiple users to share a central file system. Cloud-based options like Filestore simplify management for large amounts of data.

# What is Persistent Disk?
[<img src="./../images/pd.jpg" width=1100>](https://thecloudgirl.dev/NEXT2020.html) | [<sup>:link:</sup>](https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/google-cloud-next/complete-list-of-announcements-from-google-cloud-next20-onair)



Virtual machines are great, but what happens to your data when they restart? Persistent Disk solves this by providing reliable storage that persists even after a reboot.

Think of it like this: Imagine your virtual machine is a powerful computer, but it doesn't have built-in storage. Persistent Disk acts like an external hard drive that you can attach to your VM. This disk uses SSDs for speed or HDDs for cost-effectiveness, depending on your needs.

Choosing the Right Disk:

Just like choosing a car, there's a Persistent Disk type for every need:

- Standard PD (HDD): Affordable and ideal for basic applications and large-scale data analysis.

- Balanced PD (SSD): A good balance between price and performance, perfect for everyday workloads.

- Performance PD (SSD): Prioritizes speed, making it suitable for demanding tasks like databases and complex analytics.

- Extreme PD (SSD): Unleashes the ultimate performance for applications like in-memory databases.

Local SSD: Offers the lowest latency for lightning-fast processing, ideal for data processing and temporary storage needs.

Availability Matters:

- Local SSD: Best for temporary data in stateless applications, where data replication happens elsewhere.

- Persistent Disk: Durable storage with automatic backups, suitable for most workloads.

- Regional Persistent Disk: Highest availability option, replicated across zones for near-instantaneous recovery in case of outages.
